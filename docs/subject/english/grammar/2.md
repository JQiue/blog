## 动词

### Be 动词

be 动词的作用就是对主语补充说明

形式：be，is，am，are，was，were，being，been

+ be：将来时或虚拟语气
+ is/are：单数/复数
+ was/werr：单数/复数
+ being/been：现在分词/过去分词

```text
The man is back.
They ar back.
He was back.
They were back.
They have been back.
```

be 动词后面接名词、形容词、地点副词或短语作补足语

```text
The man is a teacher.
Mary's new dresses are colorful.
My mother was in the kitchen.
```

### Be 动词的疑问和回答

+ 构成疑问：将 Be 动词提到句首

```text
Is he a doctor?
- Yes, he is./No, he isn't.
Are you a teacher?
- Yes, I am./No, I am not.
Were they teachers?
- Yes, they were./No, they weren't.
```

否定回答：在 am, is, are, was, were 后面加 not，可缩写成 am not，isn't，aren't，wasn't，weren't

无论是肯定回答还是否定回答，都可以省略 be 动词后面的语句

```text
The man isn't back.
I am not back.
They aren't back.
He wasn't back.
They weren't back.
```

### 实意动词

实意动词在句中具有实在意义，而不是像 be 动词一样无意义

比如：come，read，go，watch，play，fly

```text
He comes from Huibei.
She is reading story books.
```

::: tip 动词的第三人称单数形式
一般现在时，主语是第三人称单数的时候，动词要变成单三形式，通常加`s`
:::

动词应该有时态上的变化，可能是有规则变化，也可能是无规则变化

```text
They went to America yesterday.
He came to Shanghai yesterday.
We are Writing homework.
They have read this book three times.
```

总结以上来说，实意动词有数量和时态上的变化

+ 构成疑问：借助助动词`do/hava`进行提问，谓语动词要用原型

```text
He often plays golf. => Does he often play golf?
They go to school by bus. => Do they go to school by bus?
Sam had breakfast yesterday. => Did sam have breakfast yesterday?
```

否定回答：在助动词 do，does，did 后加 not，可缩写：don't，doesn't，didn't

::: tip
过去式时助动词没有单复数变化
:::

```text
I don't  go to shcool by bus.
She doesn't watch TV every day.
They didn't swim last night.
```
