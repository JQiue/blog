## Lesson 1

```text
Last week I went to the theatre. 
I had a very good seat. 
The play was very interesting. 
I did not enjoy it. 
A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. 
They were talking loudly. 
I got very angry. 
I could not hear the actors. 
I turned round. 
I looked at the man and the woman angrily. 
They did not pay any attention. 
In the end, I could not bear it. 
I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.
'It's none of your business,' the young man said rudely. 
'This is a private conversation!'
